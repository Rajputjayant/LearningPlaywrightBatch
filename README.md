# LearningPlaywright

A small learning repository for Playwright examples and notes.

Contents
- `Chapter_01_Basic/` : basic JavaScript examples and setup verification.
- `Chapter_02_Java_Concept` : (placeholder) Java concept notes.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies (if this becomes a Node project):

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

2. Run Playwright tests (if added):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Notes
- `.gitignore` is included to exclude `node_modules`, Playwright reports, and IDE files.
- This README is intentionally minimal — tell me if you want a more detailed project README.
